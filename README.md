# sunnyday

When you run the application for the first time, it automatically generates the weather for the city you are in, based on geographical coordinates.
<p>As a user, you can make a list of your favorite cities, you can delete a city and see the air components. </p>
<p>All data is up to date, as local storage is used only to store the user's city list, weather requests are always made once the user reloads the page or adds a new city.</p>
